This project uses the data collected from Emirates Mars InfraRed Spectrometer (EMIRS) which is an instrument from Hope satellite launch in Emirates Mars Mission (EMM). Data used in this project are collected from Feburary 2021 to August 2022.
The data were preprocessed and used Random Forest Regressor to investigate feature importance and for feature selection.
6 different machine learning methods were used i.e. Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor, Random Forest Tree Regressor and Neural Network Regression (Multilayer Perceptron).
Detail process and implementation can be read in 'Documentation'.
